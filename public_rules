1. English only please

2. No racism/hatred will be tolerated. This is up to discretion of an admin. This will lead to instant banning! Be respectful to EVERYONE!

3. Off topic is allowed. GIFs, memes, etc. are allowed. Let's not get carried away - especially when an admin is posting builds, or if someone is trying to help someone resolve an issue. 

4. Get yourself an avatar! There are lots of people here. It is much easier to figure out who is who when they have a custom image.

5. Don't go on and on. I'm referring to someone who may send 10 messages in a row who could have simply sent 1 or 2. I'm also talking about those who feel the need to have the last say. We're all human (minus a couple of bots) - things happen. Try to let things go before they get out of control.

6. Don't bash other ROM's

7. You can respectfully request a certain feature, but keep in mind that AquariOS is intentionally skipping certain features. We also don't care which ROM has what feature - nobody is forcing you to use AquariOS.

8. Respect the admins - they are here for a reason and can warn/ban you if need be. If you have a problem with an admin, speak with another admin in a private chat, do not insist on arguing back and forth or you will be warned and/or banned if need be.

9. To access downloads, simply type the word downloads with a # in front of it (in the chat). You will see a list of devices.

10. Don't bug us asking when your device will be supported. If you don't see it listed, it's probably not in the works right now and we have no idea when it will have support.
